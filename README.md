# Hobbits on Holiday
## Description
After the arduous adventures on the road, it's time for our Hobbits to kick back and definitely not run into any trouble.  Users will log in or sign up if they haven't already created a user.  This creates a session and allows users to create a new Hobbit character.  Users can place their new character on the Map of Middle Earth.  Then users will click on an encounter button to fight a baddie.  These baddies are non-canonical characters that pull from the [D&D Api](https://5e-bits.github.io/docs/api).
